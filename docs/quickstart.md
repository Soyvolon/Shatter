# Quick Start
!> Shatter is currently in a closed beta, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJZ3-xOJKVicPSAxkkaBdMsef4zTodKc8kbfN4KbFrGcROfw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to request access.

Invite Shatter to your server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=755597498843922454&scope=bot&permissions=3468358). It is recommended to give Shatter all the permissions it asks for in order to use all features.

# Using Commands
The default prefix for a Shatter command is `]`. By specifying a command name after the prefix, you can tell Shatter to run a command.

For example, using the `botinfo` command will retrieve the information about Shatter.
```
]botinfo
```

If Shatter is not responding to commands, make sure Shatter has permission to see and send messages in the Discord channel you are using.

If some cases, Shatters prefix may have been set to something different than `]`, so make sure you are using the correct prefix.

A full list of the commands can be found [here](/command_listing).

# Modules
Modules are a way commands are grouped using Shatter. This allows to easily turn on or off groups of commands for your server.

A full list of the modules can be found [here](/commands_details).

For more information about customizing Shatter with modules, see [customization](/customization).
